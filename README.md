# Gun detection in images
This repository provides inference on detecting guns in images and videos. Object detection model has been trained on 600 plus images annotated with lableimg. Extract pre-trained model in the inference graph folder.Model has been trained for 80k epochs on Tesla K80 GPU provided by Google Colab for free.
Training folder contains config file. This code is inspired by EdjeElectronics[1]. https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10
