# Gun detection in images
This repository provides inference on detecting guns in images and videos. Object detection model has been trained on 600 plus images annotated with [LabelImg], for 80k epochs on Tesla K80 GPU provided by Google Colab for free. Training folder contains config file. This code is inspired by [EdjeElectronics]. 

Inference:
